/**
 * Tool Execution — wires up the OpenClaw skill registry so Iris can
 * perform actions as a natural part of conversation.
 *
 * Capabilities:
 *   - Search the web in real time (via Grok or web search skill)
 *   - Execute code and show results
 *   - Read and analyse uploaded documents
 *   - Generate and edit images (via connected providers)
 *   - Create files: PDFs, spreadsheets, documents
 *   - Set reminders and calendar events
 *   - Do maths and data analysis
 *
 * Each tool is available naturally — "analyse this CSV" just works.
 * Tools are registered via the skill registry (lib/ai/skills/built-in.ts).
